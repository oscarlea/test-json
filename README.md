Limits

To be able to provide a free service to as many people as possible during this phase, the project comes with a few limits:

    Changes are faked and aren't persisted (just like JSONPlaceholder)
    Requests are cached (1 minute)
    db.json has limits
    All servers are public
    Private GitHub repositories aren't supported (yet)
